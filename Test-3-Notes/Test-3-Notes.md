## Reading 56: Fundamentals of Credit Analysis

### A) Describe credit risk and credit-related risks affecting corporate bonds

* Credit Risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower (issuer of debt) failing to make full and timely payments of interest and/or principal. 

* Credit Risk has two components: Default Risk and Loss Serverity. The former is the probability that the borrower defaults and the second is the portion of a bond's value (inclduing unpaid interest) and investor loses. 

* Expected Loss = Default Probability x Loss Severity given default where Loss Severity = (1 - Recovery Rate)

* Spread Risk - Yield Spreads widen based on two factors: a decline in issuer's creditworthiness (credit migration or downgrade risk) and an increase in market liquidity risk

* + Credit Migration Risk means that bond issuer's credit rating lowers, increasing the risk of default and causing the yield spreads on the bond to widen and thereby the price to fall. 

+ Market Liquidity Risk is the risk that the price which investors can transact may differ from price indicated on the market. To compensate for the risk of not being able to buy or sell a given bond, the spread or yield premium on corporate bonds includes a market liquidity component, in addition to a credit risk component. Two main issues that affect market liquidity risk:

1) Size of the issuer (amount of publicly traded debt issuer has outstanding)
2) Credit quality of the issuer

__Less debt an issuer has outstanding, the less frequently its debt trades, and thus the higher the market liquidity risk. The lower the quality of the issuer, the higher the market liquidity risk__


### B) Describe seniority rankings of corporate debt and explain the potential violation of the priority claims in a banktruptcy proceeding

* Capital Structure is the composition and distribution across operating units of a company's debt and equity including bank debt, bonds of all seniority rankings, preferred stock, and common equity. 

* Seniority Ranking 
 + Secured Debt and Unsecured Debt - Secured has a direct claim or pledge from the issuer on certain assets and their associated cash flows. Unsecured have only a general claim on an issuer's assets and cash flow. 
 
* Priority of Claims:

  1) First/Second/Third Lien - pledge of assets that could include buildings, properties, equipment, licenses, patents, brands, etc. First mortgage debt refers to pledge of specific property. 
  2) Senior Secured
  3) Senior Unsecured - most common type of all corporate bonds
  4) Senior Subordinated
  5) Subordinated - here, investors have lowest priority of claims and oftern have little or no recovery in default
  6) Junior Subordinated
    
* Companies issue and investors buy various levels of debt with different seniority rankings so as to optimize cost of capital, find the right mix of debt and equity, market may demand more secured debt. Also, subordinated debt, for the issuer, may be cheaper than equity and less restrictive than senior debt. Also, investors may be willing to buy junior and subordinated debt becase the yield may be worth the risk. 

    
* Recovery Rates
 + All creditors at the same level of capital structure are treated as one class - senior unsecured bondholder whose debt is due in 30 years has same claim on banktruptcy as one whose principal is paid out in six months
 
 + Defaulted debt is still traded by investors and brokers if the assessment that liquidation or banktruptcy may lead to some recovery value. 
 
 + Recovery Rates can vary widely by industry - Companies that go bankrupt in industries that are in secular decline will most likely have lower recovery rates than those that go bankrupt in industries suffering from cyclical economic downturn
 
 + Recovery Rates can vary depending on when they occur in the credit cycle - closely linked to economic cycle. *Credit cycle describes the changing availability and pricing of credit. When the economy is strong or imporiving, the willingness of lenders to extend credit on favorable terms is high. Credit is less available and more expensive when the economy is weak and lenders pull back.
 
 + Recovery Rates are averages - there can be large variability. Proportion of debt in capital structure may make a difference. 
 
* Best measure of credit risk is expected loss. Having an idea how much one can lose in the event of default is a critical factor in valuing credit

* Priority of claims is not always absolute - not like a waterfall despite appearances
 * Creditors 
 

### C) Distinguish between corporate issuer credit ratings and issue credit ratings and describe the rating agency practice of "notching"

### G) Evaluate the credit quality of a corporate bond issuer and a bond of that issuer, given key financial ratios of the issuer and the industry. 

### H) Describe factors that influence the level and volatility of yield spreads

### I) Calculate the return impact of spread changes

### J) Explain special considerations when evaluating the credit of high yield, sovereign, and municipal debt issuers and issues.
