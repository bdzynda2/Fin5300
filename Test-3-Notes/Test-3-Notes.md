## Reading 56: Fundamentals of Credit Analysis

### A) Describe credit risk and credit-related risks affecting corporate bonds

* Credit Risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower (issuer of debt) failing to make full and timely payments of interest and/or principal. 

* Credit Risk has two components: Default Risk and Loss Serverity. The former is the probability that the borrower defaults and the second is the portion of a bond's value (inclduing unpaid interest) and investor loses. 

* Expected Loss = Default Probability x Loss Severity given default where Loss Severity = (1 - Recovery Rate)

* Spread Risk - Yield Spreads widen based on two factors: a decline in issuer's creditworthiness (credit migration or downgrade risk) and an increase in market liquidity risk

+ Credit Migration Risk means that bond issuer's credit rating lowers, increasing the risk of default and causing the yield spreads on the bond to widen and thereby the price to fall. 

+ Market Liquidity Risk is the risk that the price which investors can transact may differ from price indicated on the market. To compensate for the risk of not being able to buy or sell a given bond, the spread or yield premium on corporate bonds includes a market liquidity component, in addition to a credit risk component. Two main issues that affect market liquidity risk:

* 1) Size of the issuer (amount of publicly traded debt issuer has outstanding)
2) Credit quality of the issuer

__Less debt an issuer has outstanding, the less frequently its debt trades, and thus the higher the market liquidity risk. The lower the quality of the issuer, the higher the market liquidity risk__


### B) Describe seniority rankings of corporate debt and explain the potential violation of the priority claims in a banktruptcy proceeding

* Capital Structure is the composition and distribution across operating units of a company's debt and equity including bank debt, bonds of all seniority rankings, preferred stock, and common equity. 

* Seniority Ranking

### D) Explain risks in relying on ratings from credit rating agencies

### E) Explain the components of traditional credit analysis

### F) Calculate and interpret the financial ratios used in analysis

### G) Evaluate the credit quality of a corporate bond issuer and a bond of that issuer, given key financial ratios of the issuer and the industry.
